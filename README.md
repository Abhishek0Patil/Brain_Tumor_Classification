# üß† Brain Tumor Classification using CNN Framework

This project aims to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI images using advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. It combines multiple pre-trained models and ensemble learning to enhance classification accuracy.

---

## üìå Problem Statement

Manual detection of brain tumors through MRI images can be time-consuming and prone to human error. This project aims to build an automated, reliable, and accurate system to classify brain tumors into *tumorous* and *non-tumorous* categories using deep learning techniques.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Develop a deep learning framework to classify brain tumor MRI images.
- Train and evaluate multiple CNN models (VGG19, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, Xception, InceptionResNetV2).
- Use ensemble learning to improve accuracy and robustness.
- Apply preprocessing, data augmentation, and proper data splitting to ensure generalizability.

## üß™ Dataset

- Total Images: **23,994**
- Classes: **Tumorous (11,999)** and **Non-tumorous (11,995)**
- Splits:
  - Train: 80% (‚âà19,195 images)
  - Validation: 10% (‚âà2,400 images)
  - Test: 10% (‚âà2,400 images)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Preprocessing

The following image processing techniques were applied:
- Grayscale Conversion
- Gaussian Blurring
- Binary Thresholding
- Erosion and Dilation
- Contour Detection
- Cropping Region of Interest (ROI)

## üîÑ Data Augmentation

Implemented using Keras' `ImageDataGenerator`:
- Rotation (¬±40 degrees)
- Width/Height Shift (¬±20%)
- Shearing, Zooming
- Horizontal/Vertical Flip
- Brightness & Channel Shifting

## üì¶ Model Architecture

Each model follows this structure:
- Pretrained base (frozen initially)
- Flatten
- Batch Normalization
- Dense (256 neurons with ReLU)
- Dropout (0.5)
- Output: Dense(2, Softmax)
